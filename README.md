# Space_Ship_Game_PythonProject

This is a Classic Space Ship Game.   :)
<br>
Also Known as Galaga (it was released in 1981 by the Japanese company Namco).
<br>
--> Controlling a starship, the player is tasked with destroying the Galaga forces in each stage while Destroying enemies.
<br>
<br>
This is one of my Python Projects.
<br>
Required Skills like some logic building and syntaxs of modules like Pygame..etc are acquired from youtube and documentaries.
<br>
This Project is made using the python module - "Pygame". (Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing games)
<br>
It also contains a lot of sound effects and great visuals to improve your gaming experience.
